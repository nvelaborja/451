Program: Business Analyst
Project: CptS 451 Database Project, Spring 2016
Programmers: Nathan VelaBorja, Jacob Krahling
Description: This program makes use of a locally-stored mySQL database and uses a 
    winform GUI to perform queries on US Demographic information
Version History:
    0.1     Feb. 15, 2016 - Created base winform and database
    0.2     Feb. 16, 2016 - Added queries, works well
\*********************************************************************************/

/*********************************************************************************\
                                  --- Known Bugs ---
            - Queries work, but database seems to be incomplete, stopped
                after zipcode ~30000.
            - Demographics data doesn't have decimals, either a query issue or 
                a database issue.
            - States are currently hardcoded because local database is incomplete
                for some reason, doesn't affect program currently, but will need
                to be changed once database is fixed.
